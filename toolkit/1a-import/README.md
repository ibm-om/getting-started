# Import your API spec, and proxy an existing REST service
Duration: 5 mins  
Skill level: Beginner  


### Objective
This tutorial is to help you get started quickly with **API Connect** by illustrating how you can bring your existing API under management control. We'll start by importing an OpenAPI spec, and then create a passthrough API proxy for an existing REST service.

### Explore the sample app, and test the target endpoints
A sample _weather provider_ app has been created for this tutorial
- Explore this app here: http://gettingstartedweatherapp.mybluemix.net/
- Enter a valid 5-digit US zipcode to get the _**current weather**_ and _**today's forecast**_

  - The above sample weather app has been built using APIs that provide the weather data.  The endpoint to get the **current** weather data is:     _**https:// myweatherprovider<span></span>.mybluemix.net/current?zipcode={zipcode}**_
  - Test it out by clicking: https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/current?zipcode=90210  
  ![](/bluemix/1a/images/explore-weatherapp-2.png)

  - Similarly, the endpoint to get **today's** forecast data is:  
   _**https:// myweatherprovider<span></span>.mybluemix.net/today?zipcode={zipcode}**_
  - Test it out by clicking: https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/today?zipcode=90210

### Import the sample app's OpenAPI spec to create a REST API proxy
- Launch the **API Designer**
  - In your terminal, enter `apic edit`
  - Log in using your IBMid
    ![](images/screenshot_apic-edit_login.png)
  - In the **API Designer** navigation panel (left hand), click on **Drafts > APIs**
  - In the **APIs** panel, click on **Add > Import API from a file or URL**
  - I have an OpenAPI 2.0 definition of the above weather API we will use for this tutorial.  In the "Import OpenAPI (Swagger) dialog box that pops up, enter this URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-apiconnect/getting-started/master/toolkit/1a-import/weather-provider-api_1.0.0.yaml
  - Leave the _Add a product_ option **unchecked**, and click **IMPORT**

- There are a few more steps before your API proxy is ready
- In the API's **Design** view, scroll down to the **Host** panel.   
_You'll notice that the Host value is set to myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net. Change this value to_ ```$(catalog.host)``` _. By doing so, you are setting the base URL for your API proxy._
- Save your API  




### Test your API proxy
###### Test with the _API Manager test tool_
- Swith over to the **Assemble** tab,
  - Start the local test server by clicking on **Start servers** icon at the bottom of the screenshot_start-server-1
    ![](images/screenshot_start-server-1.png)

- Click â–º to test your API proxy's target invocation
    ![](images/screenshot_test-0.png)

  - In the test panel, select the **get /current** operation.  
  - Zipcode is a required parameter for this operation, so enter a valid US zip (e.g. 90210).  
  - Click **invoke**, and verify that you see:
    - 200 OK response
    - Current weather data for 90210

###### Test with the _Explore tool_  
- To test your API proxy endpoints
  - Click the _Explore_ button
  - Click on the **GET /current** operation from the palette
  - Enter a valid US zipcode (e.g. 90210) in the test box
  - Click **Call operation** to see the response

###### Conclusion

In this tutorial, you saw how an existing REST service can be invoked through an API passthrough proxy. We started by checking the availability of the sample service through the web browser. Then we created an API proxy in API Connect, and linked the proxy to the sample service to be invoked. Finally, we tested this service with API Connect's internal testing tools.
